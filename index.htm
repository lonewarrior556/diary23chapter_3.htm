      a debt of gratitude for asking me to do this talk. As I was getting it

      twenty years. I don't know if that will make it better or just longer.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Science has seemed to
      clash with the Catholic Church in the past, and while some would say that
      an uneasy truce exists today, it might be more accurate to say that our
      current knowledge of creation, from the Big Bang to the emergence of
      humans on Earth, gives us more insight in the glory of the creator than
      ever before. Technology, which is closely related but different from
      science, is increasingly offering our Catholic faith new challenges. These
      challenges start in earnest in the next twenty years, with the advent of
      molecular nanotechnology, which is when we will start controlling the
      placement of individual atoms in commercial products -- this is already
      starting to happen in limited artifacts in labs around the world. Next we
      will be faced with what is called the Singularity, the hyperacceleration
      of technological knowledge to the point where our current science is so
      obsolete that we can't make any meaningful predictions about the future.
      But there are some hints of our future even past that point, and they
      culminate in Tielhard de Chardin's Omega Point, when all the matter and
      energy in the universe is one living, intelligent entity. </span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b><u>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Introduction</span></u></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How are we different
      than first-century Christians? We live in a secular society that is
      indifferent or hostile to God. We inhabit a fallen world, we are blinded
      by original sin, and further blinded by our own personal sin. There is
      thievery and murder in the streets -- even in our hospitals; there are
      heresies taught in our schools (and even in some of our churches), and the
      evening news is full of war and rumors of war. Our brain size is the same
      as our forefathers in faith, we have the same intelligence, and the same
      senses. We are born by the painful labor of our mothers, as children we
      eat by the sweat of our father's brow. We live in joy, sorrow, and doubt
      for </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">three score
      and ten years, and then we die. There is nothing new under the sun. Well,
      maybe a little thing. Nothing really of significance. Well, two little
      things -- science and technology. It's rather strange, because in some
      ways, science and technology have little to do with theology, or with our
      religious faith. But on the other hand, (let me put on my prophet hat on)
      engineers like those in this building, and all around the world, are going
      to give us power. We're going to get lots of power. We're going to get so
      much power that if we haven't given our whole heart, mind and soul to God,
      well, we're going to be dead meat. Worse than dead meat. We're going to be
      exposed to so much temptation that if our ethics and morals aren't in line
      with the ones our loving God formed in our hearts, and in the underlying
      mathematical structure of the universe, then we're going to be such
      depraved carcasses of undead meat that, well, we'd be better off if we
      were diseased and dying peasants during the Black Death. But... we don't
      get that choice. We're going to get heaven or hell, and there's no middle
      ground. C. S. Lewis claimed that the chasm between good and evil has been
      widening ever since the Fall, and today I hope to show in a little detail
      how science and technology are playing a significant role in this
      widening. I should warn you that the things I'm going to be talking about
      today are, well, pretty unbelievable. I had to beat my head against my
      assumptions many, many times before I came to accept them. When I finally
      did, I became angry, confused, depressed, and mostly frighted. If, after I
      finish today, you don't feel that way, then I've done a lousy job of
      making myself clear.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But first a caveat:
      The Church has not said much about science and technology <i>per se</i>. A
      few years ago at Notre Dame, at one of the preliminary conferences on the
      Bishop's pastoral on economics, I raised the issue of advanced technology
      with some of the theologians. They just blew it off. "So robots build
      other robots?" they said, "So what?" I was just a lowly grad student, and
      I wasn't able to clearly articulate to them some of the coming
      technologies and their consequences -- consequences that present
      significant moral dilemmas, some of which are too strange to understand
      (I've been beating my head against some of these issues since 1976 with no
      clear answers). Anyway, I don't know what the Magisterium will say in a
      hundred years about some of my claims. When I raised some of these issues
      at Notre Dame, a lot of people, both liberals and conservatives, were
      pretty upset at me. But none were able to answer my questions. </span></b>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Science, Technology,
      Theology, and Faith</span></u></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">How is science is
      different from technology? In the </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Notre Dame Engineering
      School, they had a banner that captures the spirit of the difference:
      "Scientists discover what is. Engineers create what has never been." Well,
      the hubris of that statement should make it obvious that Notre Dame is not
      really a Catholic Univerisity, but be that as it may, while engineers
      don't really create <i>ex nihilo</i>, from nothing, they do rearrange
      atoms and bits in new and interesting ways. New to us, anyway. </span></b>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Both science and
      engineering have spiritual traps. Scientists can make the quest for truth
      into a false god, forgetting that Jesus Christ is the personification of
      Truth. Meanwhile, engineers can get so wrapped up in bending Mother Nature
      to their will that they forget that they are not in control; God is.
      Science can blind our eyes of faith, or it can make our eyes of faith see
      much farther. Technology gives us the ability to multiply loaves and
      fishes, heal the sick, walk on water, and build a stairway to the heavens.
      But it can puff up our pride in our power to accomplish great deeds, and
      as Satan, and Adam and Eve showed, pride goes before the fall. </span></b>
      </p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Today I'm going to
      gloss over how science has affected our Christian faith, both in the past,
      and barely touch on how it affects it in the present. Then I'll talk a
      little about how technology can have a significant impact on our faith in
      the near and distant future.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">History of the Church
      and Science</span></u></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Aristotle, Socrates,
      Plato, and the pagan philosophers contributed much to the foundation of
      modern science, but the Church basically ignored them as pagans for over a
      thousand years. Then Thomas Aquinas applied his genius to reinterpreting
      the Greek philosophers from a Christian point of view. In fact, he was
      accused of "paganizing the Church in his attempts to Christianize the
      pagan philosophers." But he succeeded in adding to the pagan Greek
      philsophy that became science by giving it a God-centered purpose -- to
      give glory to God's creation. And he humanized what became technology by
      giving it a God-centered purpose -- to serve the needs of every individual
      human being - who was made in the image an likeness of God. The Chinese,
      who were technologically far ahead of the Europeans, did not have these
      crucial philosophical concepts, and generally their inventions languished
      in the Emperor's palace, solely for his amusement. In my opinion, it is
      Thomas who has made Western Civilization what it is.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The enemies of the
      Church have made much of the Church forcing Galileo to recant under threat
      of torture. But the true story is much more complicated. After all,
      Galileo had been drawn to the priesthood early in his life, and most
      scientific work at the time was supported by the Church. Copernicus
      dedicated his most famous work, On the Revolution of the Celestial Orbs,
      in which he gave an excellent account of heliocentricity, to Pope Paul
      III. Ten years prior to Galileo, Johannes Kepler published a heliocentric
      work which expanded on the work of Copernicus.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">As a result, Kepler
      was persecuted by Protestants, who deemed him a blasphemer, and he fled
      for protection to the Jesuits, who were commonly known to have great
      respect for science. Unlike Copernicus, however, Galileo lived just after
      the Reformation, when Luther basically told the Church how to interpret
      Scripture, and the Church was fighting back when Galileo tried to
      reconcile his findings with Scripture by reinterpreting it. Galileo could
      have prevented the whole thing by saying something like "These are my
      observations. I don't know why it seems to contradict scripture. Can you
      help me?" But he was very well known as sharp wit -- to put it less
      diplomatically, an irreverent and obnoxious lout. He was very smart (and
      the smarter we are, the more easily we are tempted by pride) but he was
      wasn't very diplomatic. The hierarchy foresaw some of the theological
      implications of his ideas, but was foolish for getting sucked into a
      battle of wills, and as John Paul II wrote recently, should have handled
      the situation better. By God's grace, and I do mean that literally,
      because most of the scientists of the day would have supported them, the
      Popes did not commit the Church to a geocentric universe. On the other
      hand, I think the whole episode gave us a better understanding of what the
      deposit of faith means to us, helping us differentiate between tradition
      and Tradition. And to keep the philosophy of the day out. A priest named
      Niccolo Lorini sent a letter to the Inquisitors-General in Rome expressing
      his concern that the followers of Galileo "were taking upon themselves to
      expound the Holy Scriptures according to their private lights,...<i>that
      they were trampling underfoot all of Aristotle's philosophy</i>....I
      believe that the Galilieans are orderly men and all good Christians, but a
      little wise and cocky in their opinions." Although the conflict focussed
      on interpretation of scripture, it was the underlying philosophical
      foundation of the interpretations that produced the conflict. In this
      case, the official Church doctrine was aligned with the philosophy of
      Aristotle. It was the conclusions drawn from Aristotle's view of cosmology
      that Galileo challenged and not the biblical view. But nobody realized it
      at the time.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">One of the interesting
      things about the infallibility of Church teaching is that it does not
      guarantee answers to all the issues of the day. It only guarantees that if
      an answer is given, then it will be correct. The Baptists are still
      fighting the Evolution vs. Creationism battle, rather fruitlessly,
      aimlessly, and foolishly, I think. In her wisdom, the Church has seen this
      issue as a tempest in a teapot that diverts us from the real issues.
      Depending on your point of view, </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Darwin was either an
      ardent atheist, bent on the destruction of outmoded superstitions, or he
      was a nominal Christian trying to understand <i>how</i> God created the
      plants and animals on this planet. Personally, I think that Genesis
      description: "God fashioned Adam from the clay" is a poetically perfect
      way to describe our emergence from&nbsp; primordial slime, just as "Let there
      be light!" is a poetically perfect way to describe the creation of the
      Universe. The Church has little to say about the scientific details of how
      God fashioned Adam from clay -- whether it was the work of a single
      afternoon or the result of billions of years of chemical and biological
      selection. We are made up of atoms, and we haven't been around forever, so
      obviously we had some earthly origin. As one Christian palaeontologist put
      it, "Fossils show us that species appear, and they show that the species
      disappear. Everything else is conjecture." Mike Behe has done some
      interesting things with irreducible complexity, trying to show how God
      works through evolution, but personally, I think that God is more elegant
      than that. I think that the engineering disciplines of software
      engineering and Artificial Intelligence will eventually show us exactly
      how God fashioned us by processes that seem to us, random. Once we
      understand these processes, we will have no choice but to worship God - He
      is that elegant. The important thing is that God created us, that evil
      came into this world through the action of the first man, and that we are
      all tainted by this original sin. The Garden of Eden story describes the
      essential nature of human beings, and that is vitally important and true.
      It explains our daily experience, the evening news, and the course of
      history, pointing out our need for a perfect redeemer.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">About five years ago,
      fundamentalist defender Dr. Hugh Ross predicted that scientists would
      claim to find life on Mars, or elsewhere in the cosmos, and that it would
      proclaimed as proof for "godless evolution." While I reserve judgment on
      the claims of the discoverers, and on some of Ross's counterclaims, there
      is no question that people are trying using this evidence to disprove the
      Bible. This is because if they can disprove the Bible, they can disprove
      the existence of God and then can ignore His objective moral law. But you
      already knew that.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">So where are we now?
      Well, as J.B.S. Aldine put it, "Not only is this universe stranger than we
      imagine, it's stranger than we <i>can</i> imagine." So what we can do is
      follow </span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">St. Paul

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In 1929, Edwin Hubble
      discovered that the universe is expanding, much to the consternation of
      steady-state advocates. As agnostic physicist Dr. Robert Jastrow
      publicized in <i>God and the Astronomers</i>, atheists found it very
      disturbing that the universe had a creation (10 to 20 billion years ago).
      They fought the theory tooth and nail - scientists were yelling at each
      other at conferences -- over a theory. Well, the fighting's over. In 1965,
      Penzias and Wilson proved that the universe started with a big explosion
      by discovering the 3oK background radiation, the cooling remnants of the
      Big Bang, and the steady state universe hypothesis was laid to rest. Other
      findings since then are even more interesting. They show that if the Big
      Bang would have had <i>very</i> slightly different initial conditions, we
      humans, and in fact, <i>any life</i>, could not exist. I suspect that
      atheists are becoming even more disturbed.</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In his play <i>Candide</i>,
      Voltaire spoofed the idea that "We live in the best of all possible
      worlds". But what seems to be emerging from our scientific understanding
      of the Universe is that not only do we live in the best of all possible
      worlds, but that we live in the ONLY possible world. More precisely,
      cosmologists and lay persons alike have been struck by the fact that our
      existence depends on a very delicate balance between a wide-ranging set of
      highly interdependent phenomenon, ranging from atomic nuclei to stars.
      First defined 25 years ago by Brandon Carter, the Anthropic Principle
      seeks to link aspects of the local and global structure of the Universe to
      conditions necessary for the existence of thinking observers.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In their book, <i>The
      Anthropic Cosmological Principle</i> (Clarendon Press, Oxford University
      Press, Oxford, 1987 ISBN 0-19-851949-4), John Barrow and Frank Tipler
      further developed the Anthropic Principle and define three versions it:
      WAP, SAP, and FAP. The weak version of the Anthropic Principle (WAP) is
      not controversial, since as a self-selection principle, it is a
      restatement of Bayes' theorem of probability, and hence undeniable:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">"The observed values
      of all physical and cosmological quantities are not equally probable, but
      they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites
      where carbon-based life can evolve, and by the requirement that the
      Universe be old enough for it to have already done so."</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">While this may seem
      like a powerless tautological statement, the WAP can predict the
      improbability of the continuous creation theory (now disproved by the
      three degree Kelvin radiation left over from the Big Bang). In addition,
      it can predict the size and age of our universe, for if it were too old,
      too young, too big, or too small, we would not exist to observe that fact.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The strong version of
      the Anthropic Principle (SAP) is more controversial:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">"The Universe must
      have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage
      in its history."</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Obviously, one
      interpretation of the SAP (Strong Anthropic Principle) is that our one
      possible Universe was <i>designed</i> with the goal of generating and
      sustaining observers, one of the classic arguments for God's existence.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Final Anthropic

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">"Intelligent

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Teleology</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Teleology is the study
      of purposes and causes. In the last century or so, modern science soundly
      rejected the use of teleology because when it was applied to small
      domains, it degenerated into vitalism. But when applied to large contexts,
      it's predictions have been correct. For example, in 1899, Thomas
      Chamberlain used evolutionary time scales, which are really WAP
      constraints, to predict that the Sun is fuelled by non-chemical energy.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The main problem
      science has with teleology is that the Second Law of Thermodynamics, by
      predicting the Heat Death of the universe, makes it seem that the Universe
      is dysteleogical. There is evidence that a civilization restricted to
      Earth will become extinct in a mere 100 million years, even though the
      growth of scientific knowledge and economic growth has no limits.
      Therefore, a human-derived civilization can probably survive past
      10^^10^^26 years (yes, that is quite a big number, and it assumes that we
      live in an open universe, or at least a very large closed one). But
      compared to eternity, such a civilization is just the clanging of a loud
      gong, signifying nothing. Just one more vanity of vanities, a chasing of
      the wind. Or is it? God never contradicted the builders of Babel, who were
      going to make a name for themselves. He just scattered them.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The WAP predicts that
      the interaction of the fundamental forces of strong and weak nuclear
      forces, electromagnetism, and gravity, will result in carbon-based
      life-forms, because our existence imposes a stringent selection effect
      upon the type of Universe we could ever expect to observe. Specifically,
      their ratios make possible the formation of nuclei, atoms, molecules,
      planets, and stars. However, the WAP does <i>not</i> explain why even
      though it is very easy to conceive of many universes in which the
      fundamental forces are slightly different, it is extremely difficult to
      postulate a way in which of <i>any</i> kind of life could survive in them,
      much less emerge from processes of chemical evolution. There is no
      explanation, except SAP, as to why the universe seems so coincidentally
      habitable to us, while it seems so inhospitable to any life form not based
      on carbon. One way to think of this curious asymmetry is to compare it to
      a symmetric example: Imagine if your parents would have conceived a month
      earlier than when they conceived you. It's pretty easy to imagine siblings
      never born, and its very conceivable to imagine them wondering about you.
      Wouldn't it be rather weird to think that none of your imaginary siblings
      could have the capacity to ever make the same thought experiment? That is
      the situation we're in.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The First Three
      minutes</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">About 10^^-43 seconds
      after the Big Bang, X particles appeared, and at 10^^-35 seconds, they and
      their counterpart X antiparticles started decaying at different rates into
      quarks and anti-quarks. The final ratio was ten billion and one quarks to
      ten billion anti-quarks. This extremely finely unbalanced ratio is very
      important, for when the universe cooled down at one millionth of a second
      to the point at which, in terms of energy, the rest mass of protons became
      equal to the temperature (i.e. Brownian motion became non-relativistic).
      So what happened was that the ten billion quarks and anti-quarks
      annihilated each other to form photons, while the extra quarks out of each
      ten billion combined to form protons and neutrons that are collectively
      known as baryons, and we ended up with the present ratio of billion
      photons per baryon. During the next second, the protons and neutrons
      transformed very rapidly into each other to keep the number of protons and
      neutrons approximately equal. In the next three minutes, the nuclei of
      light elements formed.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There is no stable
      nucleus of atomic weight 5, so almost all the neutrons ended up in
      helium-4 (26%), while the rest of matter formed hydrogen (one proton and
      one electron), with trace amounts of deuterium (one proton, one neutron,
      and one electron), and Helium-3 (also called tridium - one proton, two
      neutrons, and one electron). The early universe ended up with an
      "interesting" quantity of Helium-4 (I think it's interesting because with
      ten billion quarks flying this way, and ten billion anti-quarks flying the
      other way, you don't expect a flipped coin to land on its edge). There is
      something called the fine structure constant (Ke2/hc=1/137 where K=1/4pe0)
      which is dependent on the strong nuclear force. If the fine structure
      constant would have decreased by 9%, then deuterium would not have been
      able to bind, while an increase by 3.4% would have made diprotons
      possible, and an increase of only .3% would have made dineutrons possible.
      In the first case, no elements heavier than hydrogen would have formed at
      the time. This actually would have been OK, because they could have formed
      later in fusion reactions. In the latter two cases, however, everything
      would have formed directly into helium. In the consequent hydrogen-less
      universe, we wouldn't have had water (the importance of water is covered
      later), but more important, we wouldn't have had stable stars, because
      helium burning stars can not last long enough for life to evolve.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But even an ideal mix
      of elements is not enough to let stars (and planets) form. The mass of
      typical stars is in the narrow range between blue giants (with short
      lifetimes) and red dwarfs (too cool to support life). This mass is a
      consequence during stellar formation of the relative strengths of the
      electromagnetic and gravitational forces. If these relative strengths
      change by more than a few percent, then again it becomes impossible for
      stable, sun-like stars to exist.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Anyway, from 3 minutes
      to 1 million years, during the radiation era, the photons at first kept
      atomic nuclei from joining with electrons to form atoms, and later huge
      radiation pressure kept protostars from forming. It is at this point that
      the "Let there be light!" can be said to apply.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Open or Closed</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The ratio between the
      potential energy of the universe (gravity between all the masses in the
      universe) and its kinetic energy (movement of all the expanding particles)
      is called W0 (Omega-null). If W0 is greater than 1, then the universe is
      closed. In other words, gravity is strong enough to counteract the kinetic
      energy of the expanding matter, stopping it and reversing its direction,
      resulting in a Big Crunch. Depending on how much greater W0 is than 1,
      such a universe may not last long enough to let life evolve (or even atoms
      or stars form), before it returns to a singularity.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">If W0 is less than 1,
      then the universe is open. This means that in a universe with weaker
      gravity, the expansion would never stop, and in most cases, the expansion
      would have occurred to quickly for stars to condense. So life can only
      arise in conditions in which W0 is close to 1. We can easily imagine
      universes in which it is not equal to 1, but life as we know it, NOR AS WE
      CAN IMAGINE IT WITH ALL THE LOGICAL AND SCIENTIFIC TOOLS AT OUR DISPOSAL,
      cannot emerge in it. What is also peculiar is how close our experimental
      measurements of W0 are to 1. Why? Nobody knows.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">To really see the
      peculiarity, we should do a thought experiment, and try to imagine a
      life-form, or even just a dumb calculator, that operates without using
      atoms. It's hard. Without chemical bonds, all you have is a type of
      ionized plasma. The only way to store a bit of information with a neutron
      star by setting it's spin in one direction or the other. But that is
      rather subjective, depending on which way you're pointing. A less relative
      method would surround the star with a smaller mass of plasma, orbiting
      either in the same direction or in the opposite direction. To switch from
      a zero to a one, or vice versa, would take the gravitational effects of a
      closely passing star. But how dependable would cosmic billiards be in
      making a switch? It would take a galaxy to put together a human brain
      equivalent, and it would have enough time to think, "I think, therefore I
      am." And then the protons would decay.</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Biochemists generally
      feel that any form of life which descends from a simpler form, and which
      in turn came into existence through chemical evolutionary processes, must
      be made up of C, H, O, and N, with a little help from water, carbon
      dioxide, ammonia, and methane.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Carbon is so important
      to life because it can form long chains and remain metastable. Silicon,
      which is just below it on the periodic table, also has valence of 4
      (electrons), but cannot form double bonds. This means that CO2 is a gas
      which is very soluble in water, thus enabling it be removed from the body
      with ease. On the other hand, when silicon combines with oxygen, it forms
      SiO4, or quartz, which is not very soluble in anything. Most carbon
      compounds are poised between two stable extremes - the fully oxidized
      forms of carbon, and the fully reduced forms, and the energy needed to get
      between these metastable states is relatively low. Carbon has more free
      radicals than any other element, so there is a huge variety of carbon
      compounds, some of which are exothermic, others of which are endothermic,
      making it possible for many reactions to occur, enabling the molecular
      evolution of life to take place. </span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Attempts in
      theoretical biochemistry have been made to base life on other elements,
      but they have met with failure. One future exception might be the
      self-replicating silicon-based robots that we will certainly be building
      in a few years, but because of the extremely high stability of silicon
      compounds, those life-like machines would not be able to emerge from the
      primordial slime of a planet.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">When a star starts
      getting old, it starts running out of hydrogen, so it starts "burning"
      helium in a fusion reaction. The gravitational contraction of the star
      helps make this fusion possible by keeping the environment at 10 million
      degrees Kelvin, at a density of 10^^4.5 grams/cm, or about a half a ton
      per cubic inch). In fact, this fusion process is how all the heavier
      elements are formed, up to iron. (Fusion after iron absorbs energy instead
      of producing it, hence the heavier elements are produced as a star goes
      nova). The nuclear reaction for three helium atoms with an atomic weight
      of four each (two protons and two neutrons) combines to form a single
      carbon atom with an atomic weight of 12, with two energetic gamma rays
      left over. The shorthand way of writing this nucleosynthetic reaction is:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">3He(4) --&gt; C(12) +

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">What is really
      happening (in slow motion) is that three helium atoms are not fused all at
      once, but that two helium atoms fuse to form beryllium. Inside a star, the
      lifetime of beryllium (10^^-17 seconds) is long enough for the following
      to occur.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">2He(4) + 99KeV --&gt;
      Be(8) + He(4) --&gt; C(12) + 2gamma</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Hoyle looked at these
      equations and realized that the equations had to be resonant, because the
      amount of carbon produced in a star would be to negligible to explain our
      existence. (Note that nuclear resonance is just a complicated way of
      saying that nuclei can have distinct, non-continuous, energy levels, and
      that neutrons and protons can undergo transitions between high and low
      energy levels to emit or absorb radiant energy). Sure enough, a few years
      later, experiments found that the 7.6549 MeV of C(12) is just above the
      energy of Be(8) plus He(4) (7.3667 MeV) so that the thermal energy inside
      the star allows the resonant reaction to occur. But there's more. The
      addition of another He(4) nucleus to C(12) would fuse it to oxygen. But
      O(16) has an energy level at 7.1187 MeV, while C(12) + He(4) has a total
      energy of 7.1616 MeV. This is much closer, but since kinetic energies are
      always positive, the oxygen formation energy level is below the carbon
      reaction, so resonance cannot occur. If it was above it, any carbon
      created would quickly be fused into oxygen. So again, the existence of
      carbon-based life is due to the fact that the ratio of the strengths of
      the nuclear and electromagnetic forces falls within a narrow band. The
      narrowness of this band, on both sides, is awesome.</span></b></p>

      carbon get out to the planets, a nova must explode the atoms into
      interstellar space. A nova begins when the hydrogen supply is exhausted in
      the inner layers of a large star, and it starts imploding. The
      gravitational energy is released in a rush of neutrinos. These neutrinos
      react with matter very, very weakly (they can travel unimpeded through
      light-years of lead) via the mechanism of the weak force, but they do
      interact, adding kinetic energy to the stellar material and exploding it
      violently into space. If these neutrinos reacted more strongly, their
      energy would be absorbed earlier by the star, and this would make the star
      energy supply last longer. But there would be no nova, and the carbon
      would stay in the star. If they reacted any less, then they would just
      leave the star without moving any material, and again the carbon would
      remain in the star (instead of becoming us).</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Theology of Water</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Despite our
      commonplace familiarity with it, water is one of the strangest things in
      the universe. Its specific heat, surface tension, heats of vaporization
      and most of its other properties have values anomalously higher or lower
      than those of any other known material. The fact that ice is less dense
      than liquid water is virtually unique among compounds. If this last fact
      were not true, we would have runaway glaciation on any planet on which any
      ice could form (as would happen with ammonia oceans, for example). Water
      also has a very high specific heat, allowing it to stabilize the
      temperature of the environment. And since water has a higher heat of
      vaporization than any known substance, then it makes it the best possible
      coolant by evaporation. Both the high surface tension and high dielectric
      constant of water speed up chemical reactions, making it an ideal solvent.
      The hydrophobic effect of water, caused its bipolar shape, is largely
      responsible for shaping enzymes and nucleic acids into their biologically
      active forms. Looking at the alternatives, it seems that life would be
      impossible without water. It turns out (the refrain is becoming familiar)
      that water's strange properties are dependent on the ratios of
      electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">These properties of
      water constrain the location and atmospheric pressure of any life-bearing
      planets. Earth is the only planet in our solar system in which significant
      amounts of water exists in all three forms: water vapour, ice, and liquid.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">For those of us with
      scientific training, and with the faith of Thomas the Apostle, it is
      comforting to find that the Design Arguments outlined by Thomas Aquinas
      are being supported by modern science. On the other hand, it is a long
      step from a non-personal force that created the universe to Jesus dying on
      the cross for each of us. But where physics and biochemistry end, the
      social and artificial sciences pick up.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Computer scientists,
      political scientists, and biologists have found recently that cooperation
      is built into the mathematical structure of the universe. For example,
      working with a variable-sum mathematical game called the Prisoner's
      Dilemma, Robert Axelrod ("The Evolution of Cooperation", Basic Books,
      1984) discovered the mathematical basis for the biblical axiom "An eye for
      an eye" and for forgiveness. Coincidentally, (yeah, right, another
      coincidence) the conditions for the utility of forgiveness are similar to
      those predicted by Eric Drexler in "Engines of Creation" and "Unbounding
      the Future" (Morrow, 1991). Barrow and Tipler cover Axelrod's work because
      they claim that the basis of mathematical game theory shows that the
      spontaneous formation of a cooperative social order actually requires a
      very strong teleology to be acting at the individual level. I suspect that
      Axelrod would disagree since the optimal "tit-for-tat" strategy can emerge
      in non-conscious entities such as bacteria by the process of natural
      selection. On the other hand, the purposeful selection of future
      expectations over immediate ones is a very teleological action.</span></b></p>

      forgotten, and is painfully relearning. Specifically, that separating the
      unitive and procreative aspects of sex is intrinsically disordered. More
      generally, we are learning that ethereal theological issues are embedded
      in the underlying mathematical structure of the universe, and they guide
      the rising and falling of nations.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The Omega Point</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Earlier, I mentioned
      that science is dysteleogical, with a minor exception being some
      interesting implications arising from the one-way direction of time. In
      contrast, engineering is profoundly teleological -- every engineering
      project has a final goal. This is why even though he was a scientist and a
      priest, Teilhard de Chardin's teleological perspectives give humanity a
      huge engineering project. But let me back up and explain his terminology.
      Just as the non-sapient life covered the Earth to form the biosphere
      (plants, animals, soil, oceans, atmosphere), so the human race covers it
      with what Tielhard calls the "noosphere", or cogitative layer. At present,
      the noosphere is only roughly organized, but it's coherence is growing as
      human science and civilization develops. De Chardin predicted that at the
      end of the universe, the noosphere, the sphere of human consciousness,
      will extend to the end of the Universe, resulting in the Omega Point. At
      this point, when all of the mass and energy of the Universe comprises a
      social, personal, thinking, and loving entity -- possibly 10^^1024 years
      from now -- then the kingdom of God will be at hand. This sounds close to
      the hubris of the </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Tower of Babel
      builders, but on the other hand, we are God's hands, just as when we feed
      the hungry, or give to the poor. Recently, physicist Frank Tipler examined
      this Omega Point from the point of view of quantum mechanics and
      cosmological physics. Surprisingly, his discoveries caused him to drop his
      atheist materialism, and to accept beliefs in a God of love, resurrection
      of the body, and life everlasting. Teilhard claims that in the far future,
      information and spiritual energy will become totally dominant over matter
      and energy, and in fact independent from it, and the noosphere will
      coalesce into the Omega Point. Speaking as a Catholic priest and mystic,
      Tielhard identified the Omega Point as the second coming of Christ.
      Speaking as a scientist, his description of the Omega Point allows some
      analysis of its properties, the key of which is that, in contrast to the
      dysteleology of the Second Law of Thermodynamics, it MUST allow mankind to
      finally escape the Heat Death or the Big Crunch. This conclusion fits in
      well with Barrow and Tipler's FAP. The strange thing is that the Omega
      Point is a singularity, similar to the Big Bang, because scientific laws
      break down at that point.</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Vernor Vinge's
      "Marooned in Real Time" (Baen Books, 1986) has popularized the term "The
      Singularity", entertaining the notion that humanity's escape from the
      "Universe as We Know It" may be much sooner than we suspect. It looks like
      the human race will encounter a situation which </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Vernon</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
      Vinge has termed "The Singularity".</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Human history has been
      characterized by an accelerating rate of technological progress, caused by
      a positive feedback loop. A new technology, such as agriculture, allows an
      increase in population. A larger population has more brains at work, so
      the next technology is developed or discovered more quickly. In more
      recent times, larger numbers of people are liberated from peasant-level
      agriculture into professions that entail more education. So not only are
      there more brains with which to think, but those brains have more
      knowledge with which to work, and more time with which to devise new
      ideas. Most of the world's population is still in the transition from
      mostly peasant-level agriculture, so the fraction of the world considered
      "developed" is constantly expanding. It is reasonable to expect the rate
      of technological progress to continue to accelerate because there are more
      and more scientists and engineers at work. In Vinge's vision, the pace of
      progress will hyper-accelerate when computers gain the raw power of human
      brains, and when they are as expensive to manufacture as to fund a Ph.D.
      candidate. At the current rate, which has been constant for about twenty
      years, this will happen around 2035, given that we also have to write the
      software run them, and speaking as a software engineer, this is new
      science -- not engineering, so I'm really going out on a limb. But right
      now, computers have the raw brainpower between a grasshopper and a mouse,
      so of course they're stupid and do exactly what you tell them.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Assuming that the
      doubling time of any technological capability continues shrinking, then
      our civilization's capabilities will soon thereafter transcend physical
      limits as we know them (speed of light, all the power of our Galaxy,
      etc.). Just as the laws of physics break down in the singularity of a
      black hole, our current scientific knowledge of the world will break down
      in The Singularity. When every morning brings a change as shattering as
      the transition from the neolithic to the electronic age, we will not
      longer be able to say anything useful about the future, and The
      Singularity will have arrived. Vinge envisions that soon afterwards (a
      month later, perhaps?), homo sapiens will become transhuman, and then a
      few days later, ascend to the next level of existence or something,
      thereby explaining the Great Silence (the Great Silence is a three hour
      discussion, so we won't go into it right now). The only way to find out
      what happens during the Singularity, he claims repeatedly, is to live
      through it.</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Especially noticeable
      since the 1940s, technology can give us additional capabilities faster
      than humans can reproduce. In terms of physical achievement, one of the
      biggest milestones was done by IBM when they built the world's smallest
      billboard -- 35 xenon atoms laid out on a very small piece of nickel to
      spell out IBM. But it was predicted many years earlier. In 1978, I was in
      Washington, DC, lobbying for the Space program, and at a party afterwards,
      I ran into another grad student, some guy name Eric Drexler, who was
      talking about building robots from individual atoms, make copies of
      themselves, and using them to do <i>in vivo</i> cellular repair. I thought
      he was crazy. No, I was <i>sure</i> he was crazy. But he was right. He
      laid the conceptual groundwork for molecular nanotechnology, the tools and
      methods that will give us exact, inexpensive control of the structure of
      matter: "A place for every atom and every atom in its place."&lt;26&gt; With the
      capability to build and control self-replicating nano-robots, many
      seemingly impossible tasks could become commonplace. For example, a
      handful of middle-class individuals could easily provide all the
      inoculations and vitamins necessary to keep alive the 8.1 million children
      per year that die from preventable diseases. Alternatively, they could
      build settlements on Mars, re-forest the Sahara Dessert, or take advantage
      of all the pleasant and mind-numbing luxuries a technologically advanced
      civilization can provide (this latter option has the advantage of
      presenting the fewest legal hassles). Molecular nanotechnology will enable
      you to get an atomically precise copy of the Mona Lisa, possibly even with
      a clone of Leonardo himself, if he left enough skin cells on his
      masterpiece. It would give us the power to turn water into wine (with only
      a little cheating), and to repair internal cellular damage (i.e. cure the
      common cold, cancer, and old age). But it does not promise happiness, nor
      a solution to evil. It can't let you fly a magic carpet, beam up to a
      starship, or raise the dead. It can't even get you a date for Saturday
      night (So what good is it?). </span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Well, take corpuscles,
      for example. People are freezing their heads in the hopes that
      nanotechnology will be able to revive them. I consider this a rather
      extreme form of experimental surgery, but if human memory is really
      encoded in the structure, and flooding your blood with antifreeze before
      you get dipped in liquid nitrogen will preserve those memories, then
      you'll be fine. But what if there is some damage that needs to be
      repaired. Well, we do brain surgery now, but how much damage can be
      repaired for you to still remain you? How much will you be you if all
      electrical activity in your brain stops and is restarted? We haven't done
      any PET scans of people having a near death experience, so we don't know.
      Of course, one of the early developments of nanotechnology is a
      permanently implanted PET scanner for many people, along with holographic
      lenses in your eyes, a cell phone in your ear, and a direct connection
      between your cerebral cortex and the web.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Needless to say, there
      will be many serious ethical dilemmas that we will face with the emergence
      of such power. I can't decide it's better if just one person has this
      power, or if everyone has it. I mean, with this technology, I can build a
      nuclear bomb in my basement without a problem. How are we going to deal
      with it? Is this going to be the excuse the government needs to use mind
      control on everyone. Because that will be possible too. But there's some
      good news.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Science fiction writer
      Isaac Asimov was an ardent proponent of halting population growth. He
      pointed out that in one or two thousand years, the entire Solar System
      would be converted into a spherical mass of human flesh, expanding at the
      speed of light. Actually, Asimov's parody is in some ways not so far from
      what will probably happen. Josh Hall recently predicted that entire
      planets (not just the surface, but the volume as well) will be transformed
      into "Utility Fog" -- arrays of micron-sized supercomputers into which
      quadrillions of humans can "upload" their minds. </span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Ralph Merkle has
      calculated that with molecular manufacturing technology, Earth has enough
      energy to support a trillion people on its surface. The Sun puts out 2.2
      billion times more energy than the Earth intercepts, so we have enough
      energy to support around ^^21 people in our Solar System.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">But it takes more than
      energy for life to flourish -- it takes matter also, in the form of the
      elements that make up organic molecules, toasters, automobiles, and
      computers. There is enough material in the solar system, in the form of
      asteroids, to build Earth-like space habitats with 3000 times the land
      area of Earth.&lt;40&gt; When we learn how to do controlled fusion on an
      industrial scale, we could take apart the gas giants (storing the excess
      energy in the form of antimatter), and multiply the land area of Earth by
      a factor of 1.2 billion, either in the form of many O'Neill space colonies
      or possibly a Dyson Ring. Coincidentally, this calculation also results in
      a possible Solar System population of around 10^^21. So at current
      population growth rates, overpopulation will not be a problem for over a
      thousand years. In addition to energy and matter, communications bandwidth
      and heat dissipation also set limits on human population, but we won't
      have to worry about any of them for a <i>long</i> time.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">However, surviving the
      major dislocations that will occur in the next two decades will not be
      easy. Will we survive the Revolution? Well, it depends on exactly how we
      approach it, how lucky, flexible, and wise we are, and how much suffering
      we can bear. When Utility Fog, self-replicating assemblers, and other
      products of the nanotech revolution are misused, they can make a full-out
      nuclear war looks like a Sunday afternoon picnic, and the horrors depicted
      in Revelations jump sharply into focus. Then again, with mature
      nanotechnology, two weeks after a full-out nuclear exchange, everything
      can be back pretty much to normal -- though the concept of normal will
      have little meaning in a world in which the need for money has almost
      disappeared, every human institution is obsolete, people posses eternal
      youth and godlike powers, and the concept of Homo Sapiens itself is
      distorted beyond recognition.</span></b></p>

      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Unfortunately,

      increases, the chances of a socially induced catastrophe are undoubtedly
      increasing also. Is there any way to face this insurmountable opportunity
      that threatens to destroy us? I believe that what lies before us is
      similar to the situation that Lucifer faced. Either we bow in humility and
      gratitude before the love and truth of God, and the stars will literally
      be our playtoys, or we arrogantly make our own way, and end up in a
      loveless and empty hell of our own choosing. Is it a privilege or a curse
      to live at a time in human history when such a momentous decision will be
      made? I cannot say. All I know is that we live in the best of times, we

      life. But what is life? If it moves; if it processes information,
      material, and energy; if it reproduces; and if it contains subsystems that
      help it keep homostatic against entropy in various environments, then I
      think it's alive. And what if it calls you "Daddy"? The Church has said
      that humans are made in the image and likeness of God, so Louise Brown and
      her clones and xeroxes are human. But what about knowbots, that we send
      out on the web on our behalf? If they make decisions on our behalf,
      without being specifically told, are they human? The Church has said that
      we should be stewards of the world, but does that mean just Earth, or
      should we subdue the whole Universe? Why? Why not? Should we bring back
      the dinosaurs? Should we save the snail darter? Or just back it up on disk

      But that is the never ending temptation. Let's say someone starts talking
      to you about evolution. The thing you have to realize is that people want
      to disprove the Bible because they don't want to listen to God. And where
      the rubber hits the road is in moral teaching. For example, I think Luther
      had good intentions in his idea of private interpretation of the Bible,
      and there were abuses happening within the Church that he was legitimately
      complaining about, but this private interpretation stuff has really gotten
      us into big trouble. For that reason, I think that within another
      generation or two, (but because everyone is going to be jacked into the
      web in less than that, it will happen much faster) the Protestants will
      reunite with the Catholic Church -- or disappear. And the reason is that
      like the fundamentalists, she teaches the Truth about morality, but in
      addition, has a well-founded theory to back it up. Of course, it helps to
      have the keys to heaven.... so anyway, when you're arguing with someone
      about evolution, whether Christian fundamentalist or secular humanist,
      it's a red herring. The real issue is about morality, and whether or not
      it's objective.</span></b></p>

      I wish I knew. I've been banging my head against the nanotech revolution
      for a long time, and the answer I used to give was to quote Linus --
      "There is no problem so big and so complicated that it can't be run away
      from." My parents were immigrants. They ran away from a problem -- the
      Russian Army -- that was too big and too complicated to face. I expect to
      do the same, once we can drop launch costs to a reasonable amount. But
      more important, because we've had </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Berlin Walls, and I
      wouldn't be surprised if paranoid Earth governments try to control access
      to Space. So we have to trust in God, we have to trust that He gave us the
      Church to be led by the pope -- we have to listen to what the pope says,
      read his encyclicals. We all have to beat our heads against the dangers of
      the nanotech revolution and think about the possibilities. Now, I've been
      warped by Star Trek and science fiction, and because of my father gave me
      theology lectures instead of bedtime stories, I can sit up and notice when
      the producer slips in an error, say about the nature of evil. I'm trying
      to do the same thing with my kids, kind of lead them, and inoculate them
      by playing the devil's advocate. And young people today need that
      foundation. When I was at Notre Dame, I noticed that when these Catholic
      kids get away from their parents, they go wild -- and they don't
      understand their faith, even though they usually get "warm fuzzies" when
      they roll downstairs to their Sunday evening dorm masses. People need to
      understand the foundations of their belief, and how those foundations
      shape the Church's moral teaching on current issues -- because that is
      what we will use to determine the best moral position on future positions.
      One of the things that I found gratifying was a discussion I had with Eric
      Drexler, when I specifically asked him, "What are the moral implications
      in determining what it means to be human?" Eric's answer, coincidentally
      enough, was similar to the original Catholic justification against
      abortion: "If there is any question on an entity's humanity, then we
      should give it the benefit of the doubt."</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">In other words, if it
      acts human, and thinks like a human, then we should treat it like a human,
      because we don't know. Only God knows. So we start with divine revelation
      on what is (eg. what is a human being), and what ought to be (eg. thou
      shalt not murder). And then, based on your situation, be it androids, or
      clones, you trace a solid path between the two.</span></b></p>

      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A. In molecular
      nanotechnology, no. Fr. Jaki has looked at Artificial Intelligence and
      declared it a big nothing, but even if he is also Hungarian, and the
      pope's physicist, he and I don't see eye to eye on a number of things.
      Some of his theological insights are brilliant, but from some of his
      comments, I'd say that he hasn't done enough computer programming. He
      thinks that computers will never become as intelligent as humans, while I
      am convinced that eventually they will. I think this is a case in which
      Clarke's law applies: ie. If an elderly scientist says that something is
      impossible, he is probably wrong. If a young scientist (well, I'm not that
      young any more) says something is possible, he is probably right. My real
      reason for claiming to be right is that we're made out of atoms. All we
      have to do is figure out how to arrange them correctly. Hey, Thomas
      Aquinas said that God cannot create a man without a soul. But we're not
      creating anything. We're just rearranging atoms, whether it's the
      old-fashioned way of conceiving a child, or the new-fangled and
      ill-begotten way of using a test tube, or of growing one made of silicon.
      It's God, in His awesomely elegant way, who somehow gives that collection

      doesn't mean that we should be Luddites, for the Church tells us that our
      work should enhance life. So we need to get into the details of whether a
      technique does one or the other. And sometimes that can be very difficult
      to understand.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Q. But isn't the
      difference in those details the difference between going to heaven or
      hell?</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">H. Yes, I think your
      are absolutely right.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Q. Does this series of
      revolutions lead to a geocentric view, or do you think there is life
      elsewhere in the universe?</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">That is a three hour
      discussion, which we unfortunately don't have time for, since this is the
      last question, but the issue is important because the Strong Anthropic
      Principle becomes the Final Anthropic Principle if we are the only
      intelligent life forms in this Universe. At that point, humans are <i>
      really</i> slam-dunked to the pinnacle of creation, in a way never
      imagined by our ancestors.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Sagan, Drake, and
      other astronomers and physics advocate the existence of ETI (Extra
      Terrestrial Intelligence), while most evolutionary biologists, like Ayala
      and Mayr, contend that Earth is probably unique in harbouring intelligent
      life. But while the biologists base their opinions on the number of
      improbable steps in the evolution in Homo Sapiens, there are two more
      arguments. The first has to do with the WAP observation that it has taken
      about four billion years for the emergence of life, and that ten billion
      years from now, such an emergence would become impossible when the Sun
      exhausts its nuclear fuel supply, becoming first a red giant and then a
      white dwarf. Given that these two numbers are of similar magnitude, and
      given the amount of time required by each step in evolution, it seems that
      the emergence of intelligent life on Earth so quickly was improbable.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">The second, more
      compelling argument, is the space-travel argument. First raised by Enrico
      Fermi, it is based on a number of concrete observations, and goes as
      follows:</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Life expands to any
      and every niche available to it.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Humans have built
      rockets that have not only landed on other planets, but have even left the
      solar system. At the rate technology is increasing in power, it is
      reasonable to expect that within a 100 years, we will able to build
      self-replicating robotic starships (possibly with humans aboard) that can
      visit, develop, and populate every star in the Milky Way within a few
      hundred million years - a very short time by cosmic standards.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">By the Principle of
      Mediocrity, which maintains that there is nothing special about humans,
      our local, or our epoch, it seems unreasonable to expect that we would be
      the first space-faring race, and reasonable to expect that some ETI would
      have already done so, because technology is not racist in any way.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">So where in the world
      are they? They should be here!</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There is no shred of
      evidence of ETI in this solar system (ignoring UFO conspiracy theorists),
      nor is there any trace of them elsewhere. A radio dish such as </span>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Arecibo</span><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">
      could pick up an ETI version of "I Love Lucy" from across the Milky Way.
      Whenever something travels at relativistic velocities, it emits Cerenkov
      radiation. So a fleet of starships would light up the sky with Cerenkov
      contrails. Dyson spheres, built by alien civilizations in order to capture
      every watt of energy from their home star (Earth only intercepts a
      billionth of the Sun's energy), would hide every star, making them
      detectable only by the faint infrared radiation that they would leak.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">There are reasons any
      one alien race would not expand into the surrounding galaxy (lack of
      tools, for example), but there is no universal reason that would explain
      why <i>all</i> of them remain silent and invisible.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Q: But if they didn't
      suffer from original sin, then they would be far superior to us.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A: Yes, that was C.S.
      Lewis's opinion, as he expressed it in his Space Trilogy. His belief was
      that the rest of the Solar System was populated by races that were in a
      state of grace.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">Q. If they are
      sinless, then maybe it's our job to temp them, to play the part of Satan.</span></b></p>
      <p style="margin: 0pt 20px;"><b>
      <span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Arial;">A. Now that's a scary
      thought, but first I think our job is to test ourselves, examine our
      hearts every day.</span></b></p>
